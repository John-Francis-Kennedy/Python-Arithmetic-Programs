## Python Arithmetic Programs

## This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic arithmetic operations.

## Part 1: Addition and Subtraction
- Asks the user to input two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).
- Computes the addition (`num1 + num2`).
- Computes the subtraction (`num1 - num2`).
- Displays the results.

Run with:
```bash
python part1_add_subtract.py
```

## Part 2: Multiplication and Division
- Asks the user to input two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).
- Computes the multiplication (`num1 * num2`).
- Computes the division (`num1 / num2`), ensuring that division by zero is handled safely.
- Displays the results.

Run with:
```bash
python part2_multiply_divide.py
```
